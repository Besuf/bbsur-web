            {`Stigma is one of the most significant barriers to receiving 
                treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD). It manifests as negative societal attitudes and
                 discrimination toward individuals struggling with substance use disorders (SUD).

                 of care they receive and their overall recovery journey. Let’s delve into how stigma influences various aspects 
                 of life and why it’s crucial to combat these prejudices.`}
